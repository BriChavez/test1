## Description

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Open the terminal._
* _Make a folder that you want to run the program out of._
* _Clone this repository to that folder._
* _Navigate to the file labled index.html_
* _Open index.html in your browser_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
