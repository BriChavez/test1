    <h2><em>My name is Bri. I am 33 and live with one roommate and two very adorable, crazy kitties. They are litter mates and love each other very much. I have been in Portlnd for over 15 years and spent the majority of my time here in the service industry. My start was in security where I ran my own company for almost five years before seting my sights on being a bartender. My body has recently decided that it is over it and I have decided to return to my first love, computers. I am definitely a bit rusty, but am continiously excited by how quickly it is coming back to me.</em></h2>
